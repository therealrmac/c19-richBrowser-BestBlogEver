# Best Blog ever exercise with Handlebars

*The basic layout of the app works, it just doesnt look that great.  Handlebars is accepting the data from my json and outputing it to the dom like it should be.*

**I'll work on the stretch goals later and make it look better too**

### Requirements

In this exercise you will use the technology you've learned to this point ( Browserify, SASS, Grunt) to
create a blog page with three short articles (You can use placeholder text for the articles).

Handlebars will be used to create your view -- a template and a JavaScript object bound together and rendered as HTML

Make sure you have a package.json file in your lib folder, either by running npm init in that folder or repurposing a package.json from a previous project that used browserify and SASS. Add the necessary packages with
npm install handlebars hbsfy --save.
Create a blog page with three short articles.
Store each article's title, author, copy/content, and published date in an object in a json file.
The blog page should be a handlebars template that will be bound to the json data.
Use the following Gruntfile.js configuration in order to precompile your template(s). Be sure to match/update this info to match your project's file structure.
